# Hibernate Repository

Welcome to the Hibernate Repository! This repository contains two projects: **sample-1** and **sample-2**. These projects demonstrate the usage and implementation of Hibernate, a popular Java-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework.

## üìÅ Sample-1

The **sample-1** project showcases the fundamentals of Hibernate and provides a basic example to get you started. It includes various features such as entity mapping, CRUD operations, and querying using Hibernate Query Language (HQL). Feel free to explore the code and see how Hibernate simplifies database interactions in Java applications.

## üìÅ Sample-2
 
The **sample-2** project expands on the concepts covered in **sample-1** and delves into more advanced features of Hibernate. It demonstrates techniques like inheritance mapping, associations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many), caching, and transactions. By studying this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of Hibernate and its capabilities.

## üìñ Installation and Setup

To set up the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shubh2-0/Hibernate.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.

3. Open each project separately in your preferred IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

4. Resolve the project dependencies using Maven. The required dependencies are already specified in the `pom.xml` files.

5. Configure the database connection details in the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file for each project. You can use your preferred database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2) and modify the connection settings accordingly.

6. Build and run the projects. The necessary scripts and instructions can be found within each project's README file.
